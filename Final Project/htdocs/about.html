    <h2>About Bootstrap</h2>
	<dl>
	  <dt><strong>Who should use Bootstrap?</strong></dt>
		<dd>Bootstrap was created for front-end developers of all skill levels.  If you have any experience with building a Web page, you can benefit from using Bootstrap.  Whether you&rsquo;re developing a personal portfolio website or an e-commerce site for a client, this framework can decrease the amount of time spent on the details and get the site up and running in no time.</dd>
	  <dt><strong>Why should I use Bootstrap?</strong></dt>
		<dd>Bootstrap provides a solution to one of the biggest difficulties developers come across while building websites.  With five main browsers currently being used on the market &mdash; Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari &mdash; extra care is required to maintain uniformity across each environment.  Additionally, developers have to keep in mind different browser versions and operating systems.  On top of these concerns, the increased use of smartphones and tablets makes coding for a variety of screen sizes and their browsers a further necessity.  Bootstrap aims to remove this problem, allowing developers to swiftly and conveniently put together a flexible website.</dd>
	  <dt><strong>How was it developed?</strong></dt>
		<dd>Bootstrap was originally created at Twitter in 2010 by Mark Otto (<a href="https://twitter.com/mdo" title="Mark Otto (@mdo) | Twitter">@mdo</a>) and Jacob Thornton (<a href="https://twitter.com/fat" title="jacob(@fat) | Twitter">@fat</a>).  Before it was released as an open&dash;sourced framework, it was called <i>Twitter Blueprint</i>, with dozens of developers jumping in to use its tools in the continuing development of the company.  A year later, on August 19, 2011, it was released into the public, and continues to serve as the style guide for development.  Since then, there have been over 20 releases and three versions, with Bootstrap 4 making it easier than ever to build websites.</dd>
