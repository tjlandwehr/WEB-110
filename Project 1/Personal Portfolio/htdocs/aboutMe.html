			<h3>Goals</h3>
			<p>One of my greatest passions is travel, thus my long-term goal is to live abroad while building websites wherever I have internet access.</p>
			<p>Until then I aspire to start a non-profit Web Development company that builds websites for startups and other non-profits.</p><br><br>

			<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>My name is Timothy Landwehr, and I was born in Louisville, KY before moving to Overland Park, KS in 1990 where I grew up.  I attended Olathe East High School and was an avid musician and performer throughout school, playing the cello, piano, guitar, and singing.  Math and science have always been my favorite subjects, but I thoroughly enjoy reading about spirituality and the world&rsquo;s different viewpoints.  Today, I am an advocate for meditation for health and spiritual wellness.</p>
			<p>In 2007, I attended the University of Kansas for a year before coming to JCCC to work on my Associate degree in Biotechnology.  I attended Iowa State University afterwards from 2010-2012 and received my Bachelor degree in Biology.  Following graduation, I stayed in Iowa and worked at DuPont Pioneer as a Research Assistant where I focused on the genetics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana" style="color: #90C7E3"><i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i></a> in an effort to improve genes in corn and soybeans.</p>
			<p>After getting laid off in 2013, I moved to Denver, CO where I worked as a server for a year at Texas Roadhouse in anticipation of starting my Master degree in Speech Language Pathology.  I attended University of Colorado Boulder starting in the Fall of 2014 and thoroughly enjoyed the perks of having mountains in my backyard.  Hiking, climbing, and skiing were top activities throughout my time there.   After a year in the program, I knew that the field was not right for me, and I decided to move home and pursue a job in Web Development so that I could eventually work from home remotely.</p>
