			<img src="../images/TLBoulderFrontView.png" alt="A profile from the top of a Boulder Flatiron"/>
			<br>The following are my top five strengths according to the <a style="color: #000033" href="https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/Purchase/en-US/Index">Clifton StrengthsFinder</a><sup>&reg;</sup>.  The associated descriptions are from Gallup.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Achiever</em> &mdash; People especially talented in the <i>Achiever</i> theme have a great deal of stamina and work hard.  They take great satisfaction from being busy and productive.</li>
				<li><em>Connectedness</em> &mdash; People especially talented in the <i>Connectedness</i> theme have faith in the links between all things.  They believe there are few coincidences and that almost every event has a reason.</li>
				<li><em>Includer</em> &mdash; People especially talented in the <i>Includer</i> theme are accepting of others.  They show awareness of those who feel left out, and make an effort to include them.</li>
				<li><em>Intellection</em> &mdash; People especially talented in the <i>Intellection</i> theme are characterized by their intellectual activity.  They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.</li>
				<li><em>Learner</em> &mdash; People especially talented in the <i>Learner</i> theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve.  In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.</li>

			<h2>Clifton StrengthsFinder<sup>&reg;</sup></h2>
			<p>The <a style="color: #90C7E3" href="https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/Purchase/en-US/Index">Clifton StrengthsFinder</a><sup>&reg;</sup> helps individuals identify their talents and strengths so they can be developed and used in the workplace and beyond. Having an awareness of one's strengths helps increase productivity as it allows for a combinations of skills and knowledge to increase compatibility with others and with one's own work.  Previously I thought I already knew my own strengths, but taking this assessment has helped me identify where to focus my efforts and where I should look for help.</p>
			<p>These attributes helped me realize what type of person I am when it comes to bringing strengths to a group setting.  In particular, I am good at:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<strong>Relationship Building &mdash;</strong> This theme describes people who are good at bringing people together, keeping energy high, and coordinating groups to carry out complex goals.  According to Gallup:
				<blockquote>Relationship builders are the glue that holds a team together. Strengths associated with bringing people together &ndash; whether it is by keeping distractions at bay or keeping the collective energy high &ndash; transform a group of individuals into a team capable of carrying out complex projects and goals.</blockquote>
				This theme is indicated by two of my top five strengths &mdash; <em>Connectedness</em> and <em>Includer</em>.<br>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
				<strong>Strategic Thinking &mdash;</strong> This theme describes people who are good at planning out future goals, and absorbing and analyzing information to make better decisions.  Acording to Gallup:
				<blockquote>Those who are able to keep people focused on what they could be are constantly pulling a team and its members into the future.  They continually absorb and analyze information and help the team make better decisions.</blockquote>
				This theme is indicated by two of my top five strengths &mdash; <em>Intellection</em> and <em>Learner</em>.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
				<strong>Executing &mdash;</strong> This theme describes people who take initiative, work tirelessly to get things done, and implement solutions.  According to Gallup:
				<blockquote>Team members who have dominant strength in the Executing domain are those whom you turn to time and again to implement a solution.  These are the people who will work tirelessly to get something done.  People who are strong in the Executing domain have an ability to take an idea and transform it into reality within the organization they lead.</blockquote>
				This theme is indicated by one of my top five strengths &mdash; <em>Achiever</em>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Interestingly enough, this assessment did a very good job at understanding who I am; if you were to ask me how I would describe myself, my answers would be similar.  I look forward to applying my awareness of these themes in group settings and thus hopefully contribute in a greater way than before.</p>
