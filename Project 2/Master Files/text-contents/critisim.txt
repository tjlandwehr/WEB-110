<h2>Criticism</h2>
      <p>The argument exists that &quot;Web 2.0&quot; does not represent a new version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> at all, but merely continues to use so-called &quot;Web 1.0&quot; technologies and concepts. Note that techniques such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX_%28programming%29" title="AJAX (programming)">AJAX</a> do not replace underlying protocols like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP" title="HTTP">HTTP</a>,  but add an additional layer of abstraction on top of them. Many of the  ideas of Web 2.0 had already featured in implementations on networked  systems well before the term &quot;Web 2.0&quot; emerged. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>,  for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides  since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also  opened its API to outside developers in 2002. Previous developments also came from research in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Supported_Collaborative_Learning" title="Computer Supported Collaborative Learning">computer-supported collaborative learning</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSCW" title="CSCW">computer-supported cooperative work</a> and from established products like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Notes" title="Lotus Notes">Lotus Notes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Domino" title="Lotus Domino">Lotus Domino</a>.</p>
      <p>In a podcast interview Tim Berners-Lee described the term &quot;Web 2.0&quot;  as a &quot;piece of jargon&quot;: &quot;nobody really knows what it means&quot;; and went  on to say &quot;if Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people  to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along.&quot;</p>
      <p>Other criticism has included the term “a second bubble,” (referring to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" title="Dot-com bubble">Dot-com bubble</a> of circa 1995–2001), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt  to develop the same product with a lack of business models. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></em> has written of &quot;Bubble 2.0.&quot;</p>
      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital" title="Venture capital">Venture capitalist</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kopelman" title="Josh Kopelman">Josh Kopelman</a> noted that Web 2.0 excited only 530,651 people (the number of subscribers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch" title="TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a>, a Weblog covering Web 2.0 matters), too few users to make them an economically-viable target for consumer applications.</p>
