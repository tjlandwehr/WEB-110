<h2>Associated innovations</h2>
      <p>It is a common misconception that &quot;Web 2.0&quot; refers to various visual  design elements such as rounded corners or drop shadows. While such  design elements have commonly been found on popular Web 2.0 sites, the  truth is that the association is merely one of fashion, a designer  preference which became popular around the same time that &quot;Web 2.0&quot;  became a buzz word.</p>
      <p>Another common missassociation with Web 2.0 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29" title="Ajax (programming)">AJAX</a>. This error probably comes about because many Web 2.0 sites rely heavily on AJAX or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHTML" title="DHTML">DHTML</a> effects commonly associated with AJAX. So while AJAX is often required for Web 2.0 sites to function <em>well</em>, it is (usually) not <em>required</em> for them to function.</p>
