					<h2>Economics</h2><br />
					<p>The analysis of the economic implications of &quot;Web 2.0&quot; applications  and loosely-associated technologies such as wikis, blogs,  social-networking, open-source, open-content, file-sharing,  peer-production, etc. has also gained scientific attention. This area  of research investigates the implications Web 2.0 has for an economy  and the principles underlying the economy of Web 2.0.</p><br />
      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Tapscott" title="Don Tapscott">Don Tapscott</a> and Anthony D. Williams argue in their book <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics" title="Wikinomics">Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything</a></em> (2006) that the economy of &quot;the new web&quot; depends on mass collaboration.  Tapscott and Williams regard it as important for new media companies to  find ways of how to make profit with the help of Web 2.0. The prospective Internet-based economy that they term &quot;Wikinomics&quot;  would depend on the principles of openness, peering, sharing, and  acting globally. They identify seven Web 2.0 business-models (peer  pioneers, ideagoras, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosumer" title="Prosumer">prosumers</a>, new Alexandrians, platforms for participation, global plantfloor, wiki workplace).</p><br />
      <p>Organizations could make use of these principles and models in order  to prosper with the help of Web 2.0-like applications: &quot;Companies can  design and assemble products with their customers, and in some cases  customers can do the majority of the value creation&quot;. &quot;In each instance the traditionally passive buyers of editorial and  advertising take active, participatory roles in value creation.&quot;Tapscott and Williams suggest business strategies as &quot;models where  masses of consumers, employees, suppliers, business partners, and even  competitors cocreate value in the absence of direct managerial control&quot;. Tapscott and Williams see the outcome as an economic democracy.</p><br />
      <p>Some other views in the scientific debate agree with Tapscott and  Williams that value-creation increasingly depends on harnessing open  source/content, networking, sharing, and peering, but disagree that  this will result in an economic democracy, predicting a subtle form and  deepening of exploitation, in which Internet-based global outsourcing  reduces labour-costs. In such a view, the economic implications of a  new web might include on the one hand the emergence of new  business-models based on global outsourcing, whereas on the other hand  non-commercial online platforms could undermine profit-making and  anticipate a co-operative economy. For example, Tiziana Terranova  speaks of &quot;free labor&quot; (performed without payment) in the case where  prosumers produce surplus value in the circulation-sphere of the  cultural industries.</p><br />
